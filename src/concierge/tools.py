"""Tools available to the Meridian National customer service concierge agent.

A few tools have deliberate rough edges so LangSmith Engine has something
to cluster after the load generator runs:

- search_banking_docs has a vague description so the model occasionally
  re-queries multiple times rephrasing
- account_lookup raises on malformed customer IDs and on IDs prefixed with
  "X" (simulated downstream outage)
- recent_transactions raises if the model passes a runaway limit
- find_branch raises on non-zip inputs
